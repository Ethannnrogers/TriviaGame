# TriviaGame

I was given the following task during my time at the UNCC Coding Bootcamp:


        ### Option Two: Advanced Assignment (Timed Questions)

        ![Advanced](Images/2-advanced.jpg)

        **[Click Here to Watch the demo](advanced-trivia-demo.mov)**.

        * You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

        * If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

        * The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

          * If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
          * If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

        * On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page)
        
        
I went with the more challenging option for this assignment to test my ability of fast learning.

The apps loads by initially showing you the loading page where you must click the button to begin the game.
The user is then taken through a series of questions, the user must decide the correct answer for each questions.
Once a questoin has been answered, the next question is displayed. After all of the questions are answered, the score
board is displayed with the results of the user, aswell as an option to reset the game.
